          <p class = "intro">Hi, my name is Mingyu Wang. <br><br>
            When I began my undergraduate study, I joined the hiking club of my university. 
            From then on, I traveled and hiked all across China with some aweson friends I met in the club. 
            I think of the days in the nature as the shiniest part of my life whenever I look back to them. 
            So I decide to record them using this site.<br><br>
            This is not a photographic exihibition, it's just a record and remenmbrance of the past days. </p>
