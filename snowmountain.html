        <h1 id = "main">Mount Gongga (2016.8)</h1>
        <p>Mount Gongga, also known as Minya Konka (Khams Tibetan pinyin: Mi'ny√¢g Gong'ga Riwo), is the highest mountain in Sichuan province, China. With an elevation of 7,556 m (24,790 ft) above sea level. It is also known to locals as "The King of Sichuan Mountains". Situated in the Daxue Shan mountain range, between Dadu River and Yalong River, part of the Hengduan mountainous region, Mount Gongga is the easternmost 7,000 metres (23,000 ft) peak in the world and the third highest peak outside the Himalaya/Karakoram, after Tirich Mir and Kongur Tagh. The peak has large vertical relief over the deep nearby gorges(wikipedia). It took me 4 days to trek around this huge mountain only to get a peek of its beauty.</p>

        <h1 id = "main2">Laojun Gletscher (2017.10)</h1>
        <p>Laojun Gletscher, not known by many, is kind of like a mysterious place in story and is still a virgin land. It's located in Li county, Sichuan province. It's the toughest route ever, only with the help of a local villager, we didn't even make it to the destination we expected, but exploring is always exciting.</p>
